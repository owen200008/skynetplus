# skynetplus
skynetplus is a server frame. It's aim is follow.
(1) Synchronous programming. all net or io operator will Synchronous. Code like single thread, no lock, less malloc/new
(2) More efficient. no waste machine cpu. no wait.
(3) Interface. bussiness supply as service
(4) Distributed. register request and response serialize func, all interface can use in any other machine.

but now it is diffcult to code (like scripting language), compile check is no useful.
